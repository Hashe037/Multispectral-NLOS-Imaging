- Perhaps remove ldif_dict
- Figure out paths
- Perhaps load in BRDF ahead of time so not continually loading in
- Perhaps load in ALL OF THE SCENE AND GEOMETRY DATA for best readibility for others
- Find which variables can be set as static instead of in params
- Have opt precon toggle
- Do full comment for performJadeBSS
- Do full comment for perform_cpa_reconstruction, cp_alg
- Cite JADE in GitHub
- Mention code is heavily intertwined so uses "blank_params" to communicate between functions
- CFOV and ground are identical
- Make more comments in future
- Update paths for basefolder and calibration
- Cite spectral color people


- Not sure if BRDF is upsampling or downsampling in processBrdfComponents and maybe made errors
- for findVantAngs, do I cut on vant pos or just angs?
- incvant_to_incang is different but same from findDalphaOcc. Should make consistent once sure
- We were previously finding "best single spec" by reconstruciton, not residuals. Residuals make more sense
- Can add other BSS methods later
- Can add ls reconstruction stuff later
- Because I inverted dalpha, I am adding a transpose to the "find_bss_mixture"
- Perhaps wrap dalpha_occ with scene_params or recon_params
- There is a -2 in the nullsize in perform_cpa_reconstruction. Can we put this into max nullsize?
- Perhaps need to hardcode the differential one. Maybe remove differential capabilities? That is extra??? Does that require LS Recon?
- Does findDiffOcc need inc_angs or inc_angs_up?
- I do not need single ground, do I? Perhaps remove all of that??????? would simplify code a lot. Use it for more complex...
- Two diff distances for totrecon?

- I was smoothing ground TWICE. How will this affect???










- Removing quanitization/normalize curves for now, can add back in if desired
- Removing extra relaxation parameters
- Removing DFOV distance relaxation for now
- Removing object filtered reconstructions for now
- Removing LS reconstruction stuff? Not needed?
- Removing smooth precon results
- Removing gaussian filtering images of MS-BSS
- Removing strongest component filtering
- Removing option to have MS-CPA have less spectra
- Removing specdif metrics
